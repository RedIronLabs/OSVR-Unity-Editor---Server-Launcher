# Using the Package

- Download the repo, and open in Unity
- Use Window > OSVR Server to setup your server

Note:  The path is expecting a trailing slash or backslash and will append one depending on the state of the Using Windows checkbox

### In-Game

- Download the repo, and open in Unity
- Use the built-in Prefab
- Drag and Drop it on your root OSVR camera

Note:  This GUI was written in a way that should be compatible with all VR views.
